    <p>Businesses collect customer data from many different channels, including physical retail, e-commerce, and social media. By using data analytics to create comprehensive customer profiles from this data, businesses can gain insights into customer behavior to provide a more personalized experience. Take a retail clothing business that has an online and physical presence. The company could analyze its sales data together with data from its social media pages and then create targeted social media campaigns to promote their e-commerce sales for product categories that the customers are already interested in.</p>

  <h2>Mitigate Risks and Handle Setbacks</h2>
    <p>Risks are everywhere in business. They include customer or employee theft, uncollected receivables, employee safety, and legal liability. Data analytics can help an organization understand risks and take preventive measures. For instance, a retail chain could run a propensity model — a statistical model that can predict future actions or events — to determine which stores are at the highest risk for theft. The business could then use this data to determine the amount of security necessary at the stores, or even whether it should divest from any locations.</p>

    <p>Software engineers can typically take up remote work or work from home because practically all of their work is done on a computer. Software engineers can work from other places, too, such as hotels, coffee shops, and shared workplaces, as long as they can interact and communicate well with their team.

    <div><p>The rich variety of data that enterprises generate contains valuable insights, and data analytics is the way to unlock them.

  <br><br>

For instance, a business can model changes to pricing or product offerings to determine how those changes would affect customer demand. Changes to product offerings can be A/B tested to validate the hypotheses produced by such models. After collecting sales data on the changed products, enterprises can use data analytics tools to determine the success of the changes and visualize the results to help decision-makers choose whether to roll the changes out across the business.
